# Octanet-ATM-Machine-Simulation
This project simulates an ATM machine system with basic functionalities like balance check, withdraw, and deposit operations. It provides an easy-to-understand and interactive console-based user interface that mimics real-world ATM interactions.

Features:
- Balance Inquiry: Check account balance.
- Withdrawal: Withdraw money within available balance and bank limits.
- Deposit: Deposit money into the account.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python (or specify any other language used)
- File Handling: Store user data in a text file or database (if applicable).
- Basic Error Handling: Insufficient balance, and withdrawal limits.
